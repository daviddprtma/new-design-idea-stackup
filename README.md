INTRODUCTION:
<br>
  Stackup is the platform for learn & earn by developers to build up their skill from the beginner to be an advanced skill based on the role that they want to learn. Stackup provide ability the developers to get learning by join the quest, or join the bounty to get more rewards from stackup. They must finish & send the quest / bounty correctly same as the expected output from the Stackup requirement. After they send the quest / bounty correctly, they must wait the result for their quest / bounty in their My Progress feature. In this section of My Progress feature, you can see the detail for the quest / bounty that you have been joined and it is divided by ongoing and past quest / bounty challenge. As an example, this is my quest records from My Progress feature that you can see in here: 

Ongoing Quest Records:

Past Quest Records:

</p>

THE PROBLEM: 
	<br>
  Sometime while I want to check my quests / bounty whether it got rewarded or not and also when I want to see which quests / bounty I did not join in the stackup, I must scroll down the page until the last page by clicking load more over & over till it reach to the end of the page. When I can say, it can be easier for us to see the detail quests / bounty challenge by make a section for the rewarded, approved, rejected, and not submitted in the past quests records individually to make it simple to find the quests / bounty challenge and not get too much scroll until to the last page.

THE SOLUTION: 
  <br>
  Here‚Äôs the solution for the new idea in My Progress feature stackup  by using the illustration to make it easier for understanding:

  </p>
  
In the new design for My Progress feature, I hope it can be like the illustration above which it can be easier for us to manage & see what quests / bounty challenge that it had past quests / bounty by clicking the down arrow past quests / bounty and afterthat, we can select anything that we want to see like as rewarded for an example. If we see in the rewarded quests / bounty, then we can only see the rewarded quest / bounty only. And for the rest, it must be same as the filtered section quests. 

CONCLUSION: 
	<br>
 I hope by giving my idea for the new design My Progress feature, stackup can make a decision whether to use my idea for the simplest design and make it smooth so we as a stackie can enjoy & comfort to make the StacUp Platform as the best platform for learn & earn. üòä‚ù§Ô∏è
